# Drupal Commerce Training by Commerce Guys Profile

## Introduction

This is the [Drupal](https://drupal.org) profile that
[CommerceGuys](http://commerceguys.com) uses in its
[training](https://marketplace.commerceguys.com/training).

It's a simplified version of the profile provided with
[Commerce Kickstart 2.x](https://drupal.org/project/commerce_kickstart)
that is amenable for a training setup.

## Installation 

### Without git

 1. Download the zip and expand it in a directory.
 
 2. Remove the profile that comes with `commerce_kickstart`
    under the root of your Drupal (Commerce Kickstart) install at
    `profiles/commerce_kickstart`. 
    
 3. Copy or move the `commerce_kickstart` sub-directory from the zip
    expanded in 1 to your Drupal (Commerce Kickstart) profiles
    directory. For instance in Linux or OSX.
    
        cp -a commerce-kickstart-training-profile-master/commerce_kickstart <drupal root>/profiles
    
    This will copy the `commerce_kickstart` subdirectory of the
